Hello <%= @user.full_name %>,
<br /><br />
Thank you for adding your restaurant to forkfile.com! We have updated your Forkfile account to enable web

<br /><br />
To access your orders from the forkfile.com website, login using your email and password, and then click on 
"My Profile" at the top right of any page. There is a section called "You are the owner of the following restaurants". 
<%= @restaurant.name %> will be listed here. When you click on the restaurant link, you will be navigated to your orders 
page. Select an order to see more information.
